**ItemsAdder Furniture Protection** is an addon for the ItemsAdder Minecraft plugin that restricts breaking of custom furniture items. It's particularly useful for minigame servers, especially those running games like BedWars, where traditional protection plugins like WorldGuard cannot be effectively used.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Furniture Protection:** Prevents unauthorized players from breaking ItemsAdder furniture.
- ✅ **Flexible Permission System:** Grants permission to break furniture with either the specific `ia.furniture.break` permission or the broader `ia.*` permission.
- ✅ **Minigame Friendly:** Ideal for games like BedWars where WorldGuard can't be used.
- 🔄 **Auto-Update Check:** On server start, the plugin checks for updates. If a new version is available, a notification is displayed in the console.

## 📥 Installation

1. **Ensure you have ItemsAdder installed on your server.**

2. **Download the latest version of the plugin from the [Releases](https://github.com/alex2276564/IAFurnitureBreakRestricter/releases) section.**

4. **Restart the server** to load the plugin.
