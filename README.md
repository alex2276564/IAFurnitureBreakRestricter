**ItemsAdder Furniture Protection** is a lightweight addon for the ItemsAdder Minecraft plugin that restricts breaking of custom furniture items. It's specifically designed for **minigame servers** (especially BedWars, SkyWars, and similar games) where traditional protection plugins like WorldGuard cannot be effectively used without causing gameplay issues.

## 🎯 When Do You Need This Plugin?

### ✅ **You NEED this plugin if:**

- 🎮 You run **minigame servers** (BedWars, SkyWars, BuildBattle, etc.)
- 🪑 You have **ItemsAdder furniture** in game lobbies or arenas
- 🚫 You **cannot use WorldGuard** in game zones (it breaks minigame mechanics)
- 🛡️ You need furniture protection **without region-based plugins**

### ❌ **You DON'T need this plugin if:**

- 🌍 You run a **Survival/SMP server** where WorldGuard can protect spawn and player regions
- 🏠 You can use **vanilla spawn protection** or **WorldGuard regions** effectively
- 🚪 Your furniture is already protected by existing region plugins

### 💡 **Why not just use WorldGuard?**

WorldGuard works great for Survival servers, but on **minigame servers**:

- ❌ Creating regions in every BedWars/SkyWars arena is impractical and causes bugs
- ❌ Players need to break/place blocks in arenas, but furniture must remain protected
- ❌ Dynamic game zones make region-based protection unreliable

**This plugin solves that** by using permissions instead of regions - furniture is protected everywhere unless the player has `ia.furniture.break` or `ia.*` permission.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Furniture Protection:** Prevents unauthorized players from breaking ItemsAdder furniture.
- ✅ **Flexible Permission System:** Grants permission to break furniture with either the specific `ia.furniture.break` permission or the broader `ia.*` permission.
- ✅ **Minigame Friendly:** Ideal for games like BedWars where WorldGuard can't be used.
- ✅ **Lightweight & Optimized:**
  - Minimal performance impact (~0.001ms per permission check)
  - Leverages LuckPerms in-memory cache for instant permission lookups
  - Zero database queries - all checks happen in RAM
  - Perfect for high-player-count servers
- 🔄 **Auto-Update Check:** On server start, the plugin checks for updates. If a new version is available, a notification is displayed in the console.

## 📥 Installation

1. **Ensure you have ItemsAdder installed on your server.**

2. **Download the latest version of the plugin from the [Releases](https://github.com/alex2276564/IAFurnitureBreakRestricter/releases) section.**

3. **Place the `.jar` file into your Minecraft server's `plugins` folder.**

4. **Restart the server** to load the plugin.

5. **(Optional)** Grant `ia.furniture.break` permission to staff members who need to manage furniture.

## ℹ️ How it works

The plugin listens for ItemsAdder furniture break interactions and cancels them unless the player has the proper permission. It does not replace WorldGuard — it’s a niche tool for arenas where regions are undesirable.
